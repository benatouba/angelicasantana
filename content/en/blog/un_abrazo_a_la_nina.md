Shy and insecure.
To that delicate and sensitive girl,
who cried and suffered.
She felt alone.
A hug to the woman I have become, stubborn and imperfect but always sincere.
Strong with a heart always too bare.
To the woman who is trying to better herself and never stops dreaming.
To the woman I am.
For all the love inside me.
For my victories and my defeats.
For all the times I stood up.
For all the monsters I faced.
A hug to the little girl I still am and always will be.
