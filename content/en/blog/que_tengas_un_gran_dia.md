This morning I woke up excited
with all the things I have to do
before the clock rang.

I have responsibilities to fulfill today.
I am important.
My job is to choose what kind of day I'm going to have.

Today I can complain because the day is rainy
or I can give thanks because the plants are being watered.

Today I can feel sad because I don't have any more money
or I can be happy that my finances push me to plan my purchases wisely.
to plan my purchases wisely.

Today I can complain about my health
or I can rejoice that I am alive.
Today I can regret everything
that my parents didn't give me while I was growing up
or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born.

Today I can mourn that roses have thorns
or I can celebrate that the thorns have roses.

Today I can pity myself for not having many friends
or I can get excited and embark on the adventure of discovering new relationships.

Today I can complain because I have to go to work
or I can shout for joy because I have a job.

Today I can complain because I have to go to school
or I can open my mind energetically
and fill it with new and rich knowledge.

Today I can murmur bitterly because I have to do housework or I can feel honored because I have a roof over my mind and body.

Today the day stands before me waiting for me to shape it and here I am, I am the sculptor.

## What happens today is up to me, I must choose what kind of day I will have.
