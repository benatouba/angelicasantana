# Welcome to Angelica Santana

I am a dreamy Galapagos woman who grew up fascinated by fashion, art, and music. I love to write and read poetry. Always thinking about the future, and always wanting to contribute to the community and with the desire to learn new things. This is my page made with love for me and for you.
