      <description>This morning I woke up excited with all the things I have to do before the clock rang.
I have responsibilities to fulfill today. I am important. My job is to choose what kind of day I&amp;rsquo;m going to have.
Today I can complain because the day is rainy or I can give thanks because the plants are being watered.
Today I can feel sad because I don&amp;rsquo;t have any more money or I can be happy that my finances push me to plan my purchases wisely.</description>

      <description>Shy and insecure. To that delicate and sensitive girl, who cried and suffered. She felt alone. A hug to the woman I have become, stubborn and imperfect but always sincere. Strong with a heart always too bare. To the woman who is trying to better herself and never stops dreaming. To the woman I am. For all the love inside me. For my victories and my defeats. For all the times I stood up.</description>
