      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up excited
with all the things I have to do
before the clock rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have responsibilities to fulfill today.
I am important.
My job is to choose what kind of day I&amp;rsquo;m going to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can complain because the day is rainy
or I can give thanks because the plants are being watered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can feel sad because I don&amp;rsquo;t have any more money
or I can be happy that my finances push me to plan my purchases wisely.
to plan my purchases wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can complain about my health
or I can rejoice that I am alive.
Today I can regret everything
that my parents didn&amp;rsquo;t give me while I was growing up
or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can mourn that roses have thorns
or I can celebrate that the thorns have roses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can pity myself for not having many friends
or I can get excited and embark on the adventure of discovering new relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can complain because I have to go to work
or I can shout for joy because I have a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can complain because I have to go to school
or I can open my mind energetically
and fill it with new and rich knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I can murmur bitterly because I have to do housework or I can feel honored because I have a roof over my mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the day stands before me waiting for me to shape it and here I am, I am the sculptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-today-is-up-to-me-i-must-choose-what-kind-of-day-i-will-have&#34;&gt;What happens today is up to me, I must choose what kind of day I will have.&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>A hug to the girl I was</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shy and insecure.
To that delicate and sensitive girl,
who cried and suffered.
She felt alone.
A hug to the woman I have become, stubborn and imperfect but always sincere.
Strong with a heart always too bare.
To the woman who is trying to better herself and never stops dreaming.
To the woman I am.
For all the love inside me.
For my victories and my defeats.
For all the times I stood up.
For all the monsters I faced.
A hug to the little girl I still am and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heal-your-wounds&#34;&gt;HEAL YOUR WOUNDS!!!🌷&lt;/h2&gt;
